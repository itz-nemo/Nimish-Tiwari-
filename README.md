# PostHog Analytics Research: Identifying Critical UX Issues Through Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview
I conducted a comprehensive user behavior analysis using PostHog analytics, which helped me uncover critical website usability issues that were negatively impacting user experience and potentially harming conversion rates.

## Research Methodology

### Rage Click Analysis
- **Approach:** I systematically analyzed rage click data over 7–30 day periods.  
- **Deep Dive Process:** I reviewed individual user session recordings to understand the context behind problematic interactions.  
- **Focus Areas:** I paid special attention to elements where users repeatedly clicked without achieving their intended actions.  

### Traffic Pattern Investigation
- **Landing Page Analysis:** I examined user entry points and navigation patterns.  
- **Conversion Funnel Review:** I analyzed user paths from landing to key actions.  
- **Source Attribution:** I investigated traffic origins and noticed gaps in UTM tracking.  

## Key Findings

### Critical UX Issues Discovered

1. **Non-Functional Article Navigation**
   - **Problem:** Blog article dropdown arrow appeared clickable but didn’t function.  
   - **Impact:** 28+ rage clicks over 30 days created a poor user experience.  
   - **User Expectation:** The visual design suggested interactivity where none existed.  

2. **Inadequate Button Sizing**
   - **Problem:** The active users button was too small for easy interaction.  
   - **Impact:** Users had to repeatedly click before successfully engaging.  
   - **Result:** This caused frustration and potential abandonment.  

### Traffic Insights

- **Landing Page Performance**
  - Primary Destination: Career page received the most direct traffic.  
  - Secondary Priority: Case studies were the second most popular content.  
  - Third Priority: Blog content followed case studies.  

- **Attribution Challenges**
  - Direct Traffic Dominance: More than 50% of traffic came from unknown sources.  
  - Missing UTM Tracking: I couldn’t properly attribute traffic sources.  
  - **Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive UTM parameter strategy.
